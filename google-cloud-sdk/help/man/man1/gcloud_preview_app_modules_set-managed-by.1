.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command is deprecated. Please use the \f5gcloud preview app
instances enable\-debug\fR and \f5gcloud preview app instances disable\-debug\fR
commands instead.

This command sets the policy for the Managed VMs of the given modules and
version. When your module uses VM runtimes, you can use this command to change
the management mode for a set of your VMs. If you switch to self\-managed, SSH
will be enabled on the VMs, and they will be removed from the health checking
pools, but will still receive requests. When you switch back to Google\-managed
mode, any local changes on the VMs are lost and they are restarted and added
back into the normal pools.
