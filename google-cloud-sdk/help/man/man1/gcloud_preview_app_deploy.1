.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command is used to deploy both code and configuration to the
App Engine server. As an input it takes one or more \f5\fIDEPLOYABLES\fR\fR that
should be uploaded. A \f5\fIDEPLOYABLE\fR\fR can be a service's .yaml file or a
configuration's .yaml file.

To use a temporary VM (with the default \f5\-\-docker\-build=remote\fR setting),
rather than the Container Builder API to perform docker builds, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set app/use_cloud_build false
.RE

See https://cloud.google.com/container\-builder/docs/ for more information.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

[\fIDEPLOYABLES\fR ...]
.RS 2m
The yaml files for the services or configurations you want to deploy. If not
given, defaults to \f5app.yaml\fR in the current directory. If that is not
found, attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration files (such as
app.yaml) in the current directory.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-bucket\fR \fIBUCKET\fR
.RS 2m
The Google Cloud Storage bucket used to stage files associated with the
deployment. If this argument is not specified, the application's default code
bucket is used.

.RE
\fB\-\-docker\-build\fR \fIDOCKER_BUILD\fR
.RS 2m
Perform a hosted ('remote') or local ('local') Docker build. To perform a local
build, you must have your local docker environment configured correctly. The
default is a hosted build.

.RE
\fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 2m
Force deploying, overriding any previous in\-progress deployments to this
version.

.RE
\fB\-\-image\-url\fR \fIIMAGE_URL\fR
.RS 2m
Deploy with a specific Docker image. Docker url must be from one of the valid
gcr hostnames.

.RE
\fB\-\-promote\fR
.RS 2m
Promote the deployed version to receive all traffic.

True by default. To change the default behavior for your current environment,
run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false
.RE

Overrides the default \fBpromote_by_default\fR property value for this command
invocation. Use \fB\-\-no\-promote\fR to disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-stop\-previous\-version\fR
.RS 2m
Stop the previously running version when deploying a new version that receives
all traffic (off by default). Use \fB\-\-no\-stop\-previous\-version\fR to
disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-version\fR \fIVERSION\fR
.RS 2m
The version of the app that will be created or replaced by this deployment. If
you do not specify a version, one will be generated for you.


.RE
